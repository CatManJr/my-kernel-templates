# my-triton-templates :floppy_disk:
This repo contains some typical triton kernel I wrote or used. I will regularly review and modify them to make my future kernel developing more easier.
## Update Memo :calling:
### Update June 6, 2025: from triton puzzles :gift_heart:
Lately, I walked through the fabulous work [![triton-puzzles](https://badgen.net/badge/Srush/Triton%20Puzzles/blue?icon=github)](https://github.com/srush/Triton-Puzzles/) to overcome the challenges I am facing in CS336 2025Spring. I passed the 12 tests and modified them to separate python files. They are very simple kernels that serve as cheat sheets for some classic algorithms, as well as how to load and store data from and to accelerators. 

### Long-term (from June 3, 2025): LeetGPU :hourglass_flowing_sand:
I am also solving challenges on [`LeetGPU`](https://leetgpu.com/challenges). I plan to gradually move my solutions here as learning notes.
